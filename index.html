                    This blog is more than just a collection of exercises: it's the story of my growth and my passion
                    for learning English.

                <p>
                    My mission is to make learning English practical, dynamic, and fun. I want this space to be not only
                    a record of my progress, but also an inspiration for those who believe that learning a new language
                    can open doors, create opportunities, and connect us to the world.

                <p>
                    Join me on this journey! Let's learn, practice, and grow together: one word, one phrase, one
                    experience at a time.

                        Making this video presentation about my son was a very meaningful experience. It allowed me to
                        practice English while describing a very important person in my life. Thanks to this activity, I

                    <h3>Activity: virtual interview</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this activity, I had to record a virtual interview with the help of a classmate. The task was
                        to simulate a job interview for a position related to my professional profile. I first
                        participated as the applicant, and then we switched roles so I also acted as the interviewer.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>During the interview, I was asked to answer the following questions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tell us about yourself.</li>
                        <li>What motivates you?</li>
                        <li>What are your hobbies?</li>
                        <li>What are your future plans if you get this job?</li>
                        <li>What are your future goals or what are your career goals?</li>
                        <li>What do you see as a major success in your life?</li>
                        <li>Why did you leave your last job?</li>
                        <li>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This exercise was very useful for practicing work-related vocabulary, improving fluency when
                        answering professional questions, and gaining confidence when expressing myself in English
                        during a job interview.

                    <p>
                        Recording this audio was a very enriching experience for my English learning. It gave me the
                        opportunity to practice speaking about my academic and professional journey, my current
                        responsibilities, and my future goals in a structured way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This practice helped me understand how to express different possibilities and decisions

                        key features of my training program. To do this, I used the digital tool Canva, which allowed me
                        to creatively combine text, images, and design. This made the brochure not only informative but
                        also visually appealing and professional.

                        and added my personal information.

            <h2>Vocabulary about Crimes and Punishments</h2>

            <div class="text-content">
                <p>
                    Learning vocabulary about crimes and punishments is very useful, as it not only helps us understand
                    news, movies, and books, but also provides us with the right words to describe situations related to
                    law and justice.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The word "crime" refers to an illegal act, such as theft, murder, or fraud. Punishment, on the other
                    hand, is the penalty a person receives after being convicted, such as paying a fine, going to
                    prison, or performing community service. Both terms are essential when discussing the legal system.
                </p>

                <h3>There are many types of crimes, and each has specific vocabulary. For example:</h3>
                <ul class="examples-list">

                    <li><strong>Armed robbery:</strong> A thief broke into a home at night and stole valuables.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shoplifting:</strong> A teenager was caught stealing from a clothing store.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cybercrime:</strong> Hackers were arrested for cybercrime after stealing online banking
                        information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kidnapping:</strong> Police rescued a businessman after an attempted kidnapping.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drug trafficking:</strong> Several people were arrested for drug trafficking near the
                        border.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These examples show how each word describes a different type of illegal activity.</p>

                <p>
                    Vocabulary for punishments is equally important because it illustrates the consequences of breaking
                    the law. Some examples are:
                </p>
                <ul class="examples-list">

                    <li><strong>Fine:</strong> She had to pay a fine for illegal parking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community service:</strong> She performed community service after being convicted of
                        vandalism.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Life sentence:</strong> The offender was sentenced to life in prison for murder.</li>
                    <li><strong>House arrest:</strong> The young offender remained under house arrest for six months.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These expressions show the range of penalties, from light to very serious.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In legal situations, we often find this vocabulary in questions and commands used by criminals and
                    police officers. For example:
                </p>
                <ul class="examples-list">
                    <li>A criminal might ask, "May I call my lawyer?" or "What are my rights?"</li>
                    <li>
                        A police officer might say, "You are under arrest" or "Please get out of the car."
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Vocabulary related to crimes can also be used in different grammatical structures, such as direct
                    and indirect speech:</h3>
                <p>
                    Direct speech: “A thief stole my purse.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Indirect speech: “She said a thief had stolen her purse.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    This demonstrates that learning the words isn't enough; we also need to practice using them in
                    context.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In conclusion, studying vocabulary about crimes and punishments expands our English skills by
                    providing
                    us with precise words to describe illegal actions, legal processes, and justice. It connects
                    language
                    learning to real-life situations, making our communication more precise and effective.

            <h2>Critical Thinking and Media Literacy</h2>
            <div class="content-container">
                <p>
                    Mass media surrounds us daily through television, newspapers, films, the internet, advertisements,
                    and more. Each form of media communicates a message, whether explicit or hidden, and these messages
                    influence how we see the world. To fully understand media texts, critical thinking is essential.
                    Critical thinking involves analyzing information beyond its surface, questioning hidden intentions,
                    and evaluating arguments to arrive at informed conclusions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Media literacy extends critical thinking by teaching us to “read” media texts more deeply. This
                    means taking a second look at what we see or hear to uncover underlying meanings. Media often
                    simulates reality through special effects, editing, or persuasive techniques, making fictional or
                    manipulated content appear real. Developing media literacy allows individuals to recognize these
                    strategies and avoid being misled or manipulated by them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Media messages are never neutral. Each text has a purpose whether to inform, entertain, persuade, or
                    profit and is designed for a specific audience defined by factors such as age, gender, lifestyle,
                    and values. Advertisers, for example, use strategies like identification, generalization, emotional
                    appeal, and celebrity endorsement to connect with audiences and influence their choices. Similarly,
                    news or documentaries may claim objectivity, but every story is shaped by the perspective of its
                    creator.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ultimately, interpreting media depends on the audience. Media texts express values, ideologies, and
                    intentions, and viewers must actively question and evaluate these messages. By asking who created
                    the text, what techniques are used, what ideologies are represented, and what the author’s
                    objectives are, individuals can form their own conclusions. Media literacy empowers people to
                    interpret messages critically, rather than simply accepting what they are told to believe.

                    This blog has been a valuable experience in my English learning process. By completing the different
                    activities, I was able to practice writing, reading, and understanding new vocabulary. Each task
                    helped me gain confidence and apply English in real-life situations, which is essential for my
                    academic and professional growth.

                <p>
                    Thanks to this work, I not only improved my language skills but also strengthened my ability to
                    express ideas more clearly and precisely. I consider this project an important step toward achieving
                    fluency and continuing to develop my communication skills in English.
